## About Iowa State Parks

In the early 20th century, Iowa State University botanist Louis Hermann Pammel (1862-1931), ISU botanist Ada Hayden (1884-1950), and the university's Landscape Architecture Extension Program played key roles in advocating for and developing Iowa's state parks. This collection includes correspondence, photographs, maps, and other materials pertaining to the people and programs active in the state park movement.
